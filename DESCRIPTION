Title: Functions to Automate Downloading Geospatial Data Available from Several
    Federated Data Sources
Description: Functions to automate downloading geospatial data available from
    several federated data sources (mainly sources maintained by the US Federal
    government). Currently, the package enables extraction from six datasets:
    The National Elevation Dataset digital elevation models (1 and 1/3 arc-second;
    USGS); The National Hydrography Dataset (USGS); The Soil Survey Geographic
    (SSURGO) database from the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS), which is
    led by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) under the USDA; the
    Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), coordinated by National Climatic
    Data Center at NOAA; the Daymet gridded estimates of daily weather parameters 
    for North America, version 3, available from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's
    Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC); and the International Tree Ring Data Bank.
