`FedData` is an *R* package implementing functions to automate
downloading geospatial data available from several federated data
sources.

Currently, the package enables extraction from nine datasets:

- The [National Elevation Dataset (NED)](https://ned.usgs.gov) digital
  elevation models (1 and 1/3 arc-second; USGS)
- The [National Hydrography Dataset
  (NHD)](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset)
  (USGS)
- The [Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO)
  database](https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/) from the National
  Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS), which is led by the Natural Resources
  Conservation Service (NRCS) under the USDA
- The [Global Historical Climatology Network
  (GHCN)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily),
  coordinated by National Climatic Data Center at NOAA
- The [Daymet](https://daymet.ornl.gov/) gridded estimates of daily
  weather parameters for North America, version 4, available from the
  Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Distributed Active Archive Center
  (DAAC)
- The [International Tree Ring Data Bank
  (ITRDB)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/paleoclimatology/tree-ring),
  coordinated by National Climatic Data Center at NOAA
- The [National Land Cover Database (NLCD)](https://www.mrlc.gov/),
  including the annual NLCD data
- The [NASS Cropland Data
  Layer](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/SARS1a.php)
  from the National Agricultural Statistics Service
- The
  [PAD-US](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/gap-analysis-project/science/pad-us-data-overview)
  dataset of protected area boundaries from the USGS

This package is designed with the large-scale geographic information
system (GIS) use-case in mind: cases where the use of dynamic
web-services is impractical due to the scale (spatial and/or temporal)
of analysis. It functions primarily as a means of downloading tiled or
otherwise spatially-defined datasets; additionally, it can preprocess
those datasets by extracting data within an area of interest (AoI),
defined spatially. It relies heavily on the
[**sf**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) and
[**terra**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=terra) packages.
